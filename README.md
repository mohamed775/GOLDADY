# üìã Objective

The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your proficiency in setting up a Laravel project, designing and implementing a database schema, creating RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations, and incorporating user authentication functionalities, including registration and login.

# üìú Task Description

In this task, you are required to set up a Laravel project for a blog application. The application should have two main entities: posts and categories. In addition to the previously mentioned tasks, you need to implement user registration and login functionalities. Your primary responsibilities include:

Authentication Endpoints :
 - Implement API endpoints for user authentication.
API Endpoints for Posts :
 - Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on posts.
API Endpoints for Categories : 
 - Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on categories.
Additional Features :
 - Implement logging for post creation, update, and deletion operations. Log entries should include relevant details for 
   auditing purposes.
 - Enhance the GET /api/posts endpoint to include information about the user who created each post.
Test Cases :
 - Write comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints, ensuring functionality, edge cases, and error handling are covered.
 - Include tests for user authentication, post operations, category operations, and logging.
